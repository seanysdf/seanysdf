Just some things on my mind today:

- Why don't they make cereal boxes with a proper closing mechanism?
- I think pigeons have meetings about which cars to target
- Has anyone ever actually finished a ChapStick before losing it?
- The word "crisp" starts at the back of your mouth and ends at the front
- If I could time travel, I'd go back to the 90s just to buy a bunch of Pokemon cards

That's all for now. Brain dump complete.
