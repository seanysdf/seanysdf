After months of trying, I finally landed my first kickflip today! It took me about 500 attempts, but I finally got it.

Here's how I practiced:
1. Started with just flipping the board without landing on it
2. Then tried landing with just my front foot
3. Finally committed to landing with both feet

The feeling when you finally land a trick you've been working on for so long is amazing. Worth all the bruises and scrapes!
