My cat has the strangest sleeping positions I've ever seen. Today I found her upside down with her paws in the air like she just doesn't care!

I swear cats don't have spines sometimes. How is this comfortable??

She stayed like this for at least an hour, occasionally twitching in her dreams. I wonder what cats dream about? Probably world domination or knocking things off shelves.
