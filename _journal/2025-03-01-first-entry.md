Today I decided to start this website to document my skating progress, share pics of my cat, and just have a place to put my thoughts.

It feels good to have my own little corner of the internet, especially with all this Web3 and social media stuff getting so complicated. Sometimes simpler is better, you know?

I'm going for this nostalgic 90s-00s vibe because that's when the internet felt more personal and less corporate. Everyone had their own weird little sites with blinking text and visitor counters.

I hope to post here regularly. No pressure though, just whenever I have something I want to share.

Until next time,
Sean
